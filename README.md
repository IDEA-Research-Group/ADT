# ADT

ADT is a framework to perform advanced data transformations on complex data structures.

This project is a part of the research contribution named "Transformation of Complex Data Structures in Big Data Environment". The idea behind it is provide Big Data developers with a powerful transformation framework to transform nested data structures such as arrays by using a concise Domain Specific Language (DSL). 

This is the core project, it implements the Data Transformation Functions engine as well as a Scala-based Domain Specific Language.

ADT has been proven in Apache Spark. The integration with further Big Data tools is a future work.

## Future work

Regarding the future work for this project, 

- Generalize the Data Transformation Functions implementation.
- Enrich the DSL grammar.
- Generalize the DSL to support other programming languages.
- Develop connectors to integrate ADT with other Big Data tools.
